It contains 13 convolutional layers and two fully connected layers at the end, and has over 138 million parameters, around 100 times as many parameters than the network we made above. Like our first network, the majority of the parameters are stored in the connections leading into the first fully-connected layer.\n",

        "VGG16 was made to solve ImageNet, and achieves a [8.8% top-5 error rate](https://github.com/jcjohnson/cnn-benchmarks), which means that 91.2% of test samples were classified correctly within the top 5 predictions for each image. It's top-1 accuracy--equivalent to the accuracy metric we've been using (that the top prediction is correct)--is 73%. This is especially impressive since there are not just 97, but 1000 classes, meaning that random guesses would get us only 0.1% accuracy.\n",

        "In terms of implementation, it's easier to simply create a copy of VGG from its input layer until the second to last layer, and then work with that, rather than modifying the VGG object directly. So technically we never \"remove\" anything, we just circumvent/ignore it. This can be done in the following way, by using the keras `Model` class to initialize a new model whose input layer is the same as VGG but whose output layer is our new softmax layer, called `new_classification_layer`. Note: although it appears we are duplicating this large network, internally Keras is actually just copying all the layers by reference, and thus we don't need to worry about overloading the memory."
